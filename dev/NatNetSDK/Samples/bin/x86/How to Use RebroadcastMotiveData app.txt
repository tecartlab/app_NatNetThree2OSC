How to guide on using RebroadcastMotiveData CONSOLE APLLICATION
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

RebroadcastMotiveData is an application that takes commandline arguments.

Run the application from the command prompt or from a batch file is recomended.

To run the serial port protocol (LightCraft Previzion specific):
./>RebroadcastMotiveData.exe [ip address] [port] lightcraft [test]

	*ip address is the ip address of the machine running Motive. The easiest way to set this
	up is run RebroadcastMotiveData.exe on the same machine as Motive and pass the loopback
	ip {127.0.0.1} 

	*port is the serial communication port to send the data out on. This would be a port
	that is on the same machine that RebroadcastMotiveData is running on example{COM1}

	*lightcraft specifies the type that is being used. It is a required argument to run
	this protocol.

	*Test is an optional argument that puts the application in tests mode, slowing down
	the stream of data and including more print outputs

	This protocol tracks a rigid body and sends it back as a camera, formated for spydercam
	protocol. Create a rigid body in Motive and set the user ID under properties to 42. 

To run the XML protocol (Unity specific)
./>RebroadcastMotiveData.exe [ip address 1] [ip address 2] unity

	*ip address 1 is the ip address of the machine running motive, where the data is coming 
	from.

	*ip address 2 is the ip address of the machine recieving the XML packets, where the data
	is going
