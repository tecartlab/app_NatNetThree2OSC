NaturalPoint, Inc.

NatNet SDK is a simple Client/Server networking SDK for sending and receiving
NaturalPoint data across networks.  NatNet uses the UDP protocol in conjunction
with either multicasting or point-to-point unicasting for transmitting data.

Please refer to the NatNet API USer's Guide for more information.

         server/client versions are in synch.

Changed: Updated to Visual Studio 2005 Project files.
